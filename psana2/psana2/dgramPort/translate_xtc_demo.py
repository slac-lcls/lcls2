# Examples
# The LCLS1 dgrams are organized differently than the LCLS2 version
# In LCLS2, the configure contains all the names in the subsequent event dgrams
# This isn't the case for LCLS1, so I define the first event as a pseudo-configure
# and the second event as a configure for the rest of the events
# There is an edge case for the crystal data, as the second event is blank
# This causes a segfault when loading the LCLS2 xtc file with DgramManager
# My workaround is to define the second event as the configure for the events
# with the optional offset argument to translate_xtc_demo
