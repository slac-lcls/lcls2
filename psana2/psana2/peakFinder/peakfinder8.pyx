    # 
    # Explanation of the peakfinder_8 arguments.
    #
    # max_num_peaks: the maximum number of peaks that will be detected. Additional peaks
    #            will be discarded.
    # 
    # data: an array storing the data on which to perform the peak search. Must be a 2D
    #            array storing panels as described by the asic_nx, asic_ny, nasics_x
    #            and nasics_y arguments.
    # 
    # mask: a mask used to mark areas of the 'data' array to  be excluded from the peak search.
    #            Each pixel in the mask must have a value of either 0, meaning that the
    #            corresponding pixel in the data frame must be ignored, or 1, meaning that the
    #            corresponding pixel must be included in the search. The map is only used to
    #            exclude areas from the peak search: the data is not modified in any way.
    #
    # pix_r: a radius map, an array of the same size as 'data', storing for each pixel the
    #            distance of the pixel from the center of the detector.
    #
    # asic_nx: The size in pixels of the x axis of each detector's ASIC.
    #
    # asic_ny: The size in pixels of the y axis of each detector's ASIC.
    #
    # nasics_x: The number of ASICs along the x axis of the 'data' array.
    # 
    # nasics_y: The number of ASICs along the y axis of the 'data' array.
    #
    # adc_thresh: the minimum ADC threshold for a pixel to be considered for peak detection.
    #
    # hitfinderi_min_snr: the minimum signal-to-noise ratio for the peak above the local
    #            background.
    # 
    # hitfinder_min_pix_count: the minimum number of pixels required for a peak.
    #
    # hitfinder_max_pix_count: the maximum number of pixels allowed for a peak.
    #
    # hitfinder_local_bg_radius: the radius (in pixels) for the estimation of the local
    #           background.
