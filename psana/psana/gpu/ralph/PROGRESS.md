# Ralph Loop Journal — psana2 GPU MVP

Append-only. Newest entry LAST. Each iteration appends: date, what was done,
numbers with log paths, keep/revert decision, recommended next step.

## 2026-07-10 — Iteration 0 (seed, written by the setup session, not the loop)

**State at loop start:**

- Branch `features/psana2-gpu-mvp` at the end of the 2026-07-07/08 measurement
  campaign. All campaign numbers and verdicts are in `TASK.md`; sweep logs in
  `bench_mpi_sweep/` at repo root. Correctness is bit-exact on two datasets.
- `notes/cpu_push_prototype.md` restored from git history (it was removed in
  the slim commit 958878d6e) so the loop can read the original design.
- Baseline status per PROMPT.md §1:
  - B-CPU (CPU-only psana at scale on FFB): **not measured** — biggest gap.
    `bench_calib.py --compare-cpu` is serial-only; it needs an MPI-safe CPU
    path (same collective-DataSource pattern the GPU path uses) so CPU and GPU
    are measured at identical rank layouts.
  - B-MVP: measured. 210 Hz (1 node / 32 BD), ~295 Hz (2 nodes / 64 BD),
    ~306 Hz (4 nodes / 64 BD). Logs: bench_mpi_sweep/sweep_*.log,
    slurm-31047910 / 31062160 / 31048352.
  - B-FULL (original features/psana2-gpu branch on FFB/r387): **not measured**
    on comparable footing. Old numbers (100 Hz no-D2H, 60 Hz EventPool) are
    from a different dataset/filesystem — context only.
- Open question left by the campaign: the multi-node ~300 Hz plateau is real
  and un-attributed (smd0, EB count, batch size all ruled out). No BD-rank
  profile (read vs H2D vs kernel vs MPI-wait split) exists yet.
- Tooling probed on sdfampere029 (job 31244832,
  `bench_mpi_sweep/tooling_probe.log`): nvidia-smi dmon, CuPy CUDA events,
  pinned alloc, IB counters all available; nsys/ncu NOT installed; DCGM dead.
  See PROMPT.md §8 for how to use them and §6 for the sync-timing trap.

**Recommended next step (iteration 1):** establish B-CPU — add an MPI-capable
CPU benchmark mode to `bench_calib.py` and run it at 1 and 32 BD ranks on FFB,
same layout as the GPU rows. This anchors every future speedup claim.

**Standing user instructions:**
- Commit each iteration; push only when the human asks.
- Never cancel Slurm jobs the loop did not submit.
