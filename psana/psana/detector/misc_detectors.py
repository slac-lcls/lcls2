        From Zach:
        “Scale” is copied from the configured “units per encoderValue”
        configuration. So a scale of “6667” means we have 6667 units per count.
        What is the unit? Well, I coded it to be “nanometers per count”
        for the average axis that is controlled in millimeters, since for
        most axes this ends up being an integer, but this axis is controlled
        in microradians, so that “normal case” conversion doesn’t really fit.
        Checking the code, the configured scale for the encoder is 0.0066667
        urads/count. I guess that makes sense since you’d usually multiply
        by 1e-6 to go from mm to nm.
 
        So to get the “real motor position” you would in general do:
        Position (real units) = encoderValue * scale * 1e-6
        Which works for the current encoderValue and the real position
        shown in the screen.
 
        Though clearly the scale is rounded in this case, with a true
        value of 2/3 * 1e4

        The Controls group has conventions of mm/urad for linear/rotary
        motion units, so this routine returns urad for the rix mono encoder.
